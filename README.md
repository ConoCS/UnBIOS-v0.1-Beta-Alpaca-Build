# UnBIOS-v0.1-Beta-Alpaca-Build

---
## What project is this?
I'm ambitious about creating a custom 16-bit BIOS. Honestly, this project started just for fun. But when I take "just for fun" seriously, who knows—it might turn into something big, right?

## Alpaca?
I like alpacas :>

## What language is this BIOS written in?
I'm using 100% pure Assembly. However, I’m open to using languages like C in the future (especially for a 64-bit BIOS).
